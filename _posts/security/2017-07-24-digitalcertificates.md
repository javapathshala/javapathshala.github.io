- Provide a means of proving your identity in electronic transactions, much like a driver license or a passport does in face-to-face interactions.
- Can assure friends, business associates, and online services that the electronic information they receive from you are authentic.
- You don’t know this guy, but I do, and he’s okay by me – Stamped by me
- Used for a variety of electronic transactions including e-mail, electronic commerce, groupware and electronic funds transfers
- Provides a  "lock" required for encrypting the information and a tool for "identification" to identify the opponent technically
- Certificate is an electronic document that uses a digital signature to sign the public key created by the RSA algorithm (asymmetric-key cryptography) with the private key of the certificate authority (CA).
- Issued by CA & signed with CA’s private key.
- To authenticate – need a certificate , private & public key
- A digital code that can be attached to an electronically transmitted message that uniquely identifies the sender. Like a written signature, the purpose of a digital signature is to guarantee that the individual sending the message really is who he or she claims to be. Digital signatures are especially important for electronic commerce and are a key component of most authentication schemes. To be effective, digital signatures must be unforgeable. There are a number of different encryption techniques to guarantee this level of security.
- Issuers – Verisign, Thawte.
- In India – TCS,NIC,IDRBT Certifying Authority, SafeScrypt, CA Services, MTNL Trust Line, E-MUDHRA
