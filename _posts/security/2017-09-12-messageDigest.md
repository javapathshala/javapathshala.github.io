-  A message digest is a cryptographic hash function containing a string of digits created by a one-way hashing formula.
-  Encryption is a two-step process used to first encrypt and then decrypt a message
-  Hashing condenses a message into an irreversible fixed-length value, or hash
-  MD5 & SHA-1
-  Only used to verify the data. Message cannot be retrieved back.
-  Hash is a result of the original message plus a secret key
-  md5sum and sha1sum utilities on a Linux or UNIX machine to experiment with hashing
-  Also known as Message Digest , Hashing, Checksum.
-  Checksums or digital fingerprints at download sites
