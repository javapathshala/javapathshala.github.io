- High performance Distributed Memory object caching system
- Speed up dynamic web application by alleviating database load.
- An in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.
- Memcached's APIs provide a giant hash table distributed across multiple machines
- Subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in least recently used (LRU) order in case table is full.
- Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.
- Simple design promotes quick deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing large data caches
- Supports the exponential scalability of social web applications like Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube etc.

## Advantages
- Reduces database load.
- Perfect for websites with high database load.
- Significantly reduces the number of retrieval requests to database.
- Cuts down the I/O access (hard disk)

## Disadvantages

- Not a persistent data store
- Not a database
- Not application specific
- Cannot cache large objec
