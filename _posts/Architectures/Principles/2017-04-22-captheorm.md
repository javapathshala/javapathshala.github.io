* CAP theorem is becoming known due to the increase hype around No-SQL database.
* CAP theorem, also known as Brewerâ€™s theorem,
* States that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
* Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
* Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed)
* Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss). According to the theorem, a distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three.
