#### Preparation
It is highly recommended and I did it personally to attend a 5 day course on TOGAF training course from authorized centers. Training sessions touch base all topics & gives you baseline for preparation.

But hey don't just stop here. You need to a do a many more activities

- Read TOGAF V9.1 book - as many times you can
- Attempt mock test repeatedly - as many times you can
- Prepare pick up points

For awareness, I myself creaed bunch of *pick up* points as ready reference & would be happy to share very soon. For sharing purpose they are under revision & would be shared  very soon for FREE.
