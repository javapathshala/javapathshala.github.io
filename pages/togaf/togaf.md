TOGAF is one of the must have certification for Technical/Solution/Eenterprise Architect. It gives architect a chance to formally get inside of all artefacts that architect must implement or at least aware of them.

In this I would not take a conventional view of TOGAF - how to practice ,how to prepare for it, but I will share my personal experience - how I started and what needs to be done, how to release pressure.

<blockquote>TOGAF is easy to attain & easy to maintain, difficult to prepare and easy to clear, it consumes lot of time while preparing but saves exponential time when you apply its fundamental to your project.</blockquote>

You may consider - I am a great architect & have many project implementation under my belt so why should I even try for TOGAF. You may be right in your thought but TOGAF is a kind of ethical hacker. It can hep you add values to thier archtecture but letting you know of world's best processes in place.
<blockquote>
TOGAF is Agile in nature & thus iterative
</blockquote>

TOGAF talks about each and every process starting from Project initiation to project governance and organisations that uses TOGAF as a strategy are now out of their sick practices and architecture which actually turning out to be better in their increased return on Investments.

<blockquote> Don't forget it places your resume head of all other Architects who does not posses TOGAF certification.</blockquote>
